# Simplify the program below by creating a function that turns the turtle left 10 then moves forward 10.
# Finally replace the left(10) and forward(10) commands with your new function.
# Bonus: Create another new function that makes an entirely new shape.
#   Include it in the while loop and see what happens!
i = 0
while i < 100:
    circle()
    left(10)
    forward(10)
    i = i + 1
