import turtle

# 1. Change the value my_variable to make the turtle draw a square!
# 2. Change the value my_variable to make the turtle draw a triangle!
# 3. Use the size variable to make it so that you only have to change one value to change the size of the whole shape!
#     Note: If you're confused about this one, see Elliot or Duncan for help!
